        "1. RoBERTa is a reimplementation of BERT with some changes in the key\n",
        "   hyperparameters and minor embedding tweaks. It uses a byte-level BPE as a tokenizer and a different pretraining scheme.\n",
        "2. RoBERTa is trained for longer sequences i.e. the number of iterations\n",
        "   is increased from 100K to 300K and then further to 500K.\n",
        "3. RoBERTa uses larger byte-level BPE vocabulary with 50K subword units instead\n",
        "   of character-level BPE vocabulary of size 30K used in BERT.\n",
        "4. In the Masked Language Model (MLM) training objective, RoBERTa employs dynamic masking to generate the masking pattern every time a sequence is fed to the model.\n",
        "5. RoBERTa doesn’t use token_type_ids, and we don’t need to define which token\n",
        "   belongs to which segment. Only separate segments with the separation token tokenizer.sep_token (or ).\n",
        "6. Larger mini-batches and learning rates are used in RoBERTa’s training.\n",
        "7. NSP is removed from its objective."
